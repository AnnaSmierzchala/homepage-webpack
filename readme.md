# Homepage - my first project!

This is a simple website with notes created for the needs of frontend [training](https://cotenfrontend.pl/). It is based on the webpack starter kit. 


## What you can find here?

This project is kind of the playground to testing what I was learning during the course.
Furthermore there is a lot of information here about html, css, javascript and other useful tools for a modern frontend developer.
